# Nanoc Skeleton

A basic, content-free bootstrap of Nanoc set up with bundler, sass, markdown, Mongrel, and a simple Rake task.

Also includes some dandy Sass mixins.

## Fairly Obvious Setup

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    rake #clears the output directory, runs Mongrel on port 9210.

That's it.

- Rake tasks (mostly) from [Rob Emerson's post](http://www.remerson.plus.com/articles/nanoc-rake/)
- Also you can't beat the [Nanoc wiki](http://projects.stoneship.org/trac/nanoc/wiki)
